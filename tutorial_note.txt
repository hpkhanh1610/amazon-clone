- React ROUTER:
  + reactrouter.com/web
  + `npm install react-router-dom`
  + import libraries + wrap in <Router></Router>: parent
  + Route (children): determines what's going to load

  + { Link } component: non-refresh way. Without this, the page will refresh
  + `href` will refresh the page >< `<Link>` does not.

- shortcut to create React functional component: `rfce` (ES7 react extension)

- bem naming convention
- NEED to install @material-ui/core for every project
- !important: replace the rules of material-ui css, with our custom rule
- emmet in vscode: go to settings, click option trigger expansion on TAB

- padding vs margin:
  + padding: add space inside the element
  + margin: outside

React: most important feature: just reload only a specific of components, not entire web page

.product > img: if we dont want to create a className.
 + product: parent class
 + img: child tag

- object.splice()
- expr1 && expr2: If expr1 can be converted to true, returns expr2; else, returns expr1.

Login:
1. Redirect to homepage
- history.push('/'): we want to `push` because when we hit back button, we can go back to that previous page.
2. Listen to user's login/logout status and update the data layer
